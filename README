A javascript implementation of the classic game "Zatacka".

Note: Development of the networked branch has been indefinitely suspended. I realized that it would require dealing with several minutae like keeping track of which rooms are empty and then cleaning them up periodically. Also, to demo it to people I would have to keep a node server running all the time, and I don't really trust my code enough to do that on my production website.

All further development in the foreseeable future will happen in the "local" branch.
